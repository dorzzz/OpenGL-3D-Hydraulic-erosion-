# OpenGL-3D-Hydraulic-erosion-
Developed an OpenGL final project as part of my Computer Graphics course, showcasing 3D rendering and interactive graphics techniques. 

## how to open ? 
On a windows machine make sure you have visual studio installed.
then just download the code file and double click on the Graphics.sln and let visual studio open  it .

## instructions :
to launch the 3D terrain world just run the code . 
the terrain is randomally generated. 
right-click on the window and click on "Start Erosion" 
to stop the erosion you could just left-click on the window or right-click again and choose "Stop Erosion" .
to smooth the terrain ( all it does is it takes 3x3 cells and calculate the avg to get a "Smooth" effect ) left-click on the window or right-click and click "Smooth Once" )
